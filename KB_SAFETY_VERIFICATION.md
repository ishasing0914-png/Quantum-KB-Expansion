- No runtime changes: This operation did not modify application source code, runtime configuration, or any executable assets.
- No copyrighted copying: Content is neutral, summarized reference notes citing canonical sources (e.g., Nielsen & Chuang, peer-reviewed articles). No textbook chapters or verbatim copyrighted passages were copied.
- No executable content: The KB contains no scripts, binary assets, or tools; it is safe to store in the repository as documentation-only.
